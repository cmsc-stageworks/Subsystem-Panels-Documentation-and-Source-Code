Since we replaced the background scale, this can 
pop out kind of, and the needle can get stuck on
it, to fix this you will have to pull it down and 
take it appart so the front plastic is gone, then 
I found taking a screwdriver and applying pressure 
to the scale fixes it most times, I know it 
sounds bad, but it works supprisingly well and if 
you are careful it shouldn't break it.
