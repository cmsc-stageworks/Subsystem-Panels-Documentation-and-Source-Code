check to see if the background color is turning 
to the correct color, if it is than that means
more likely then not that you have a bad gauge
and will have to replace it, but you can check
to see if the connection to the gauge is correct
and take a multimeter to the incoming voltage
to check and see if it is correct, it should
be liniar 0-5v, 5v being max on the gauge 0 being
the min.
