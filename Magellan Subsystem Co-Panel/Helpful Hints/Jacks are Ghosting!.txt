If you are using a metal panel, then it is probably
some power going through the panel, just check and
make sure there is no exposed cables touching the 
panel, if there is none, check that all the jack 
detect plugs on the subsystem poriton are pulled 
away, if none of these fix it, you will have to 
insulate the jacks using some electrical tape or 
glue, just make it so the metal of the jack isn't 
touching the panel.
