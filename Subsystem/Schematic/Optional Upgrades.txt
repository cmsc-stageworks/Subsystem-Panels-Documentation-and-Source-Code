If you would like, you can add a reset button, it is super simple.
All you have to do is connect ground to one pin on the button and 
the other to the reset pin on the arduino. If your reset button
has a light, just hook the positive side through a resistor to 5v
and the negative end to GND.

For the power switch, just put it between the VIN on the arduino 
and the 5-6V power supply positive. This will stop the 5v and 3v3
regulators on the arduino from suppling power to the rest of the
panel. If you aren't using the arduino's 5v power regulator to 
power everything, then put the powerswitch between the power supply 
and the positive rail of your panel.

Another upgrade you may consider is puting one diode(properly oriented)
on each button in the grid, this will make it so you can press more than
one button at a time without it ghosting, and could make it slightly more
reliable.

None of these upgrades will change the main function of the 
panel, they are just nice features, the first two are both 
installed on all of the first wave of panels, so they can be 
easily turned off at night and can be reset if the user 
accidentally starts the wrong puzzle. The reason the diodes
aren't on the panels is that we finished all of them by the
time I thought of it, so if we print new pcb's I will 
Implement it, but it will most likely not be put in for a 
while.
