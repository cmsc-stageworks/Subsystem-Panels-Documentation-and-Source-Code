Notes:

Nathan Ford 9/4/24:

This module was originally made in Eagle IDE. They then took away my license so I had to switch to KiCad.
I apologize that it isn't fully made in KiCad, it may make editing it harder
The original Eagle Library is found in this folder and KiCad lets you import it and it actually plays pretty nice with the Eagle library.
When remaking the module for an ethernet redesign I had to create a new KiCad library though, so not all of the symbols are centralized
I Hope that nobody ever has to read this or redesign this, but I am leaving this note just in case it can help someone in the future.
Have fun!
