The featherboard looks, well like lights, to make it look more 
smooth I recomend using a diffusing agent, I have tried several
Different materials, and have found, supprisingly, papper and
masking tape is the most effective diffuser, but as you can 
guess, it is not very durable, so I recomend taking some plastic
and coting the back in masking tape then putting the plastic
side facing the user. This makes the "tank" look super cool.
